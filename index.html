    <h2>Why Tarangire National Park?</h2>
    <h3>Tarangire, the land of Elephants</h3>
    <p>
        Tarangire National Park is famous for the thousands of elephants that come down to the park during the dry season in search of water, but there are also plenty of wildebeest, zebras, giraffes, buffalo and hippos.
Lions are often sighted, and you might see leopards and cheetahs patrolling the grasslands, or perched in a tree. Wild dogs have been spotted before, but you have to get lucky to find them.
The park is also a great birding destination, with over 500 species living in Tarangire.

          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>
            Hi! My name is Anna and I was born in Tanzania. My father
            instilled a love of going on a safari in me. From an early age we
            travelled with our landrover through the Game reserves and National
            Parks of Tanzania. My favourite park is Tarangire National Park.
