    <h2>Why Tarangire National Park?</h2>
    <h3>Tarangire, the land of Elephants</h3>
    <p>
        Tarangire National Park is famous for the thousands of elephants that come down to the park during the dry season in search of water, but there are also plenty of wildebeest, zebras, giraffes, buffalo and hippos.
Lions are often sighted, and you might see leopards and cheetahs patrolling the grasslands, or perched in a tree. Wild dogs have been spotted before, but you have to get lucky to find them.
The park is also a great birding destination, with over 500 species living in Tarangire.

                <h4>Tarangire Safari Lodge</h4>
                <p>
                Since 1985, family-owned & managed Tarangire Safari Lodge has been well known for its location and panoramic views. They cater to wildlife enthusiasts and those seeking rest and relaxation in this beautiful national park.
                </p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>This lodge had the best location to spot wildlife even when you are having a meal. It lies on top of a hill which gives you beautiful panoramic views and you are surrounded by beautiful trees and regular visits from the antelopes or the elephants.</p>

                <h4>Mawe Ninga Camp</h4>
                <p>
                Set on top of a dramatic granite kopje to the west of the main river in the Tarangire area of northern Tanzania, Mawe Ninga Camp is by far the best mid-priced option in the area, with guest accommodation in 16 tented rooms and providing access to good range of safari activities.
                </p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>The uniqueness of this camp is that it is built around the enviroment surrounding it. The views are great and the rocks make it one of its one kind. The rooms are stunning and it really makes for a unique experience.</p>

                <h4>Little Chem Chem</h4>
                <p>
                Set on Burunge Wildlife Management Area to the northwest of Tarangire in northern Tanzania, Little Chem Chem is an elegant high-end option, with guest accommodation in six tented suites and providing access to good range of safari activities. Private vehicles.
                </p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>This lodge is one  of the most luxorious ones with a higher price but they are passionate about conservation and helping the local community. The location is different from the other two as it is located on the plains. </p>

          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>
            Hi! My name is Anna and I was born in Tanzania. My father
            instilled a love of going on a safari in me. From an early age we
            travelled with our landrover through the Game reserves and National
            Parks of Tanzania. My favourite park is Tarangire National Park.
